Assignment 4 - Using `Scrollview`, `Modal` and `ActivityIndicator`

## About
A banking app UI which displays all the saved cards and the history of the transactions made by the user.
When the app is opened it shows `ActivityIndicator` when loading the transaction history. Both the history and the card are inside the `Scrollview` and when a transaction history item is pressed it shows additional details with the help of `Modal`.
